# PyStatsV1 Organization

> Applied statistics in plain Python — cross-disciplinary, reproducible, and beginner-friendly.

Welcome! **PyStatsV1** is an open-source organization focused on **applied statistics education**.

Our flagship repository is:

- **[PyStatsV1/PyStatsV1](https://github.com/pystatsv1/PyStatsV1)**  
  Chapter-based Python scripts that mirror classical R textbook analyses, with:
  - synthetic teaching data,
  - reproducible figures and JSON outputs,
  - Makefile targets and CI smoke tests for each chapter.

---

## What we care about

- 🎓 **Teaching statistics with real code**  
  Textbook-style examples implemented as plain, inspectable Python scripts.

- 🔁 **Building a bridge between R and Python**  
  Many classic applied stats texts are R-first; PyStatsV1 offers line-by-line Python counterparts.

- 🧪 **Reproducible workflows**  
  Makefiles, CI, and synthetic data so results can be rerun, checked, and reused.

- 🤝 **A welcoming community**  
  Clear CONTRIBUTING guidelines, “good first issues,” and mentor-style code review.

## Who should get involved?

- **Students** learning applied statistics or data analysis.
- **Instructors / TAs** who want classroom-ready demos and synthetic datasets.
- **Practitioners** who prefer scripts and CLIs over heavy frameworks.
- **R users** who want a gentle path into Python-based workflows.

You don’t need to be a statistics expert to contribute — we have issues across a range of difficulty levels (docs, tests, refactors, new examples).

## How to get started

1. Visit **[PyStatsV1/PyStatsV1](https://github.com/pystatsv1/PyStatsV1)**.
2. Read the [README](https://github.com/pystatsv1/PyStatsV1#readme) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pystatsv1/PyStatsV1/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
3. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
4. Open an issue if you’d like to propose a new chapter or case study.

## Roadmap (high level)

See the repo-level [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/pystatsv1/PyStatsV1/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for details, but at a glance:

- Expand regression chapters (logistic, Poisson, etc.).
- Add power and sample size simulations.
- Add more epidemiology-focused examples (risk ratios, odds ratios).
- Grow a library of teaching case studies and chapter-specific docs.

If you’re an educator and want to align your course with PyStatsV1, we’d love to hear from you via GitHub Discussions or a “Course report” issue.

---

## Stay tuned

As the organization grows, we plan to:

- Use GitHub Discussions for Q&A and design ideas.
- Publish Sphinx-based documentation on Read the Docs.
- Highlight courses and institutions using PyStatsV1.

If you care about **open, reproducible statistics education**, you’re in the right place. 💙
